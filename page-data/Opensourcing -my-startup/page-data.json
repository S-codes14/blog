We have a startup idea … That is not that good… A working prototype… With no users… And a life with no friends.</p>\n<p>So i started creating this YouTube series to document the journey of creating a billion dollar startup, but instead gave you boring videos, we don’t even have a name for this startup, we initially wanted to go to the moon 🌒💫 but now it seems as if we’re going nowhere, we’re not even in a spaceship. This startup failed before it even took off.</p>\n<p>This is all just negative emotions talking, I think I can still\nMake this work right, 😂😂😂 lol, this is the end of Randolly…  Wait Randolly maybe that could be the name of the app. Maybe the app isn’t such a failure after all\nIt can’t be worse than Google wave - the project that was open sourced instead of being killed, wait a minute… </p>\n<p>Open source is the way to go, since nothing like “Randolly” has been open sourced- well we can’t be sure of that but I haven’t found anything like it on GitHub but since nothing like it has been open sourced we can create the first social media management app that is open source, immediately giving us an advantage over our competitors because our users can trust us. So there’s only one thing to do now…\nGet rich 🤑 🤑 lets get rich and buy our parents houses in the suburbs yeah</p>\n<p>Open sourcing the startup only came as a last minute option as I was about to hit the kill button for Randolly, this was because I didn’t see the app going to the moon 🚀 instead it was going six feet down, also I made a prototype and the response I got from my frenemies is that the app sucked, some didn’t even open the link that’s how much they hate me but haters gonna hate , we are going to the moon by force even if we have to hijack the spaceship, And its not because I’m a  black South african 🇿🇦  🙃.</p>\n<p>Whats the better way than to have over-qualified developers working on your codebase for free, now that is thinking smart and not working at all, I’m joking having a startup open source startup is a lot of work and at the same  time there’s a lot to consider:</p>\n<p>First of all i just want to clarify this one thing, I’m a high school student but since my startup is open source some people would criticize my bad code but guess what jokes on you cause I don’t care as long as it works, jeez i sound like a bad developer, but the proplem is the critisizer instead of complaining about the bad code why don’t you contribute to fix it mhmm 😒 who’s laughing now.</p>\n<p>Second thing to consider about going open source is  security because instead of contributing some attackers will spend hours browsing your code just to find an exploit that they can use against your users but Linus’s law might work to our advantage “given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow”, that doesn’t mean we have to store passwords as text you also have to consider better ways of beefing up security on the bright side we might find security engineers contributing before the attackers attack, Its one of the benefits open source.</p>\n<p>Third thing to consider is intellectual theft where competitors steal your ideas to use on their own services but everyone steals ideas, do you think I’m the first person to think of social media management as a matter of fact I was inspired by the poor services given by buffer the point is that . In software ideas are cheap. Value is almost always created in execution of ideas. When you share your ideas with the world, it frees up your brain to focus on things that matter most. Instead of spending time worrying about which contractors or partners have access to your code base, you can focus on iterating faster. You’ll probably be surprised how the open source community responds to your openness.</p>\n<p>But there are also other benefits to make your startup open source: </p>\n<p>It Solves your development talent problem because we would be creating a community of experts, experts that are good at solving problems with that being said we can say that the future of humanity looks great 👌 with good problem solving skills the rate of innovation increases.</p>\n<p>It Improves product greatly, many companies are being accused of selling user data these days but since our code is open source people will develop a sense of trust towards the product but besides that competitors will use some of our ideas to better theirs but that’s the point of competition you want to make it a little better so with that said you can say that the future of social media management will increase greatly. </p>\n<p>But their are other benefits of opensourcing your startup that i haven’t mentioned this is just the tip of the ice either way everyone benefits from open source, the people, competitors, and the service in general 🚀</p>\n<p>In a world with no open source, technology companies everywhere are re-inventing the wheel, on loop… forever. </p>\n<p> I just opensourced Randolly because I didn’t want  to waste developer time and effort! It is still in it’s prototype phase.\nBy the way you can check out <a href=\"https://github.com/randolly/randolly\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/randolly/randolly</a>\nIf you are interested in contributing.
