Their first mistake is that they teach us the skills we don’t want to learn and the skills we want to learn are not included, i learnt more from YouTube then school, YouTube even thought me to code,  you see that’s the skill i wanted to learn and since learnt it willingly you put in more hours without someone forcing you, yet with school you are forced to learn what they want you to learn the problem 😒 with that is that they also expect you to pass or do well.</p>\n<p>No wonder i want to drop out so badly its then they are pushing me to the edge. I actually spoke to my father about dropping out he says the only way for me to do that is to create a pasaive income, and since i want to drop out so badly i even thought about freelance  but now what’s on my mind is to create a startup, but that’s the problem i don’t know how to make it successful because school doesn’t teach you that see where im going school is  often glorified for the things it doesn’t do.</p>\n<p>Let  me guess they want us to get a job right after graduating what about teaching you to be self-employed, especially with the current unemployment rate thats in our counties what about that🙄</p>\n<p>Then they want me to take school seriously 🤣 never.\nI will fail proudly 😊</p>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"title":"Back to school😔 ","date":"April 05, 2022","spoiler":"Do you know the pain of waking up early in the morning even before the sun  🌤️ is out just to go to a place you dispise the most.
