In this post I’ll focus less on data structures and more on algorithms specifically how to write them, by giving you a blueprint that you can use all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve divided this into 5 steps, I’ll first explain then give a pseudo-code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1.(specification)&lt;/strong&gt; You need to specify what exactly it is that you are going to do or a description(in a form of a comment), this is just to see if you really understand the problem that you are trying to solve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2.(pre-conditions)&lt;/strong&gt; This is the step where you specify the conditions on input, the variables that you are going to use &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3.(Body of the algorithm)&lt;/strong&gt; This is where the actions happen, you have all the tools of the programming language to your disposal, it is up to you to use the right one to solve the probleto ac&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4.(Post-conditions)&lt;/strong&gt; After you have completed your actions in step 3, this is the product that you wish to have&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5.(Improve)&lt;/strong&gt; As I’ve said in my last post - There are many diiferent ways of writing an algorithm that do the same thing but what sets them apart is performance.This is the step where you think of better ways of completing what you just completed in order to make it faster or to make it use less memory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I am going to put this blue print into action by creating a simple algorithm that adds two numbers( i will be writing in psuedo-code):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;step 1:  //add two numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;step 2:  declare 3 integers, a &amp;#x26; b to have values, c is empty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;step 3:  add the values of a &amp;#x26; b&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;step 4:  c is equal to the answer of step 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;step 5:  This algo is already fast if you are going to just use (+) operator that comes built in programming languages But binary addition with bitwise would be much faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look you don’t have to follow the blueprint I just gave you there are many ways to kill a cat, but it is really important that algorithms have the same characteristics, here are some good characteristics of an algorithm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Input&lt;/strong&gt; 0 or well defined inputs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Output&lt;/strong&gt; 1 or well defined output&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;feasible&lt;/strong&gt; algorithms should terminate at some point and not go on forever e.g infinity loop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;independant&lt;/strong&gt; algorithmic step by step direction should not be dependant on any programming language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;unambiguos&lt;/strong&gt; algorithms must be clear and directed to one meaning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would often start then give up as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time is different, I am literally forcing myself to learn them and in this blog post I’m going to give a quick introduction by explaining data structures and algorithms in the simplest way possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Algorithms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the word might seem prestigious, it is nothing but a list of instructions for performing a specific task. If you have been coding then you have been writing algorithms all along, it is a procedure of having well defined steps for solving a particular problem or producing a particular result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to think of an algorithm as a recipe(the one used for cooking) because it tells you a list of steps and actions that you must take in order to make food&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different types of algorithms that perform different tasks such as: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sorting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;searching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deleting &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inserting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;updating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different ways of writing an algorithm that does the same thing but they are distinguished by performance and perfomance for algorithms is measured by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;time (amount of time for an algorithm to execute)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;space (the amount of memory required by the algorithm)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Structures.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the name implies, they are structures that store and organize data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data structures are built in a way that data values have relationships amongst them and that there are functions and operations built-in to manipulate the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example would be an array/list, a data structure that you have probably used in your coding career. There is a relationship between index of an array and size of an array (The array is indexed from 0 to size-1.). There are operations/functions such as sorting, deleting,inserting etc. all built-in into the array data structure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;types of data structures include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;linear data structures (they are arranged in a linear order meaning that they are non-trees and non-graph, examples would be: arrays; linked lists; stacks; and queue.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;non-linear data structures (they do not form a sequence and each element or item is connected with two or more other items, examples would be trees and graphs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are probably asking yourself why do we have so many data structures, the reasons are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;processor speed (cpu processes some data structures faster than others)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;data search (efficent retrival of specific data differs amongst diiferent data structures)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;multiple request (some data structures take longer to make multiple requests)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the number of data structures, just having one is advantage because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are efficient (fast)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are reusable (build once use anywhere)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are abstractable (process of filtering out)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I mentioned earlier that there are functions built into data stuctures, the common ones are: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traversing (iterating over the data)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insertion (adding a new item in any place in the data structure)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deletion (removing an item form anywhere in the data structure)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;searching (finding the location of any element within the data structure)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sorting (arranging data in a specific order)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;merging (adding two or more groups of data to form a single unified set)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc.. many more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion.&lt;/strong&gt;
This post was so that I can explain algorithms and data structures, Theres still a vast majority that I still need to cover from Big O notation to creating algorithms and data structure to algorithmic thinking hopefully in future posts, this was just an introduction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

We have a startup idea … That is not that good… A working prototype… With no users… And a life with no friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So i started creating this YouTube series to document the journey of creating a billion dollar startup, but instead gave you boring videos, we don’t even have a name for this startup, we initially wanted to go to the moon 🌒💫 but now it seems as if we’re going nowhere, we’re not even in a spaceship. This startup failed before it even took off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all just negative emotions talking, I think I can still
Make this work right, 😂😂😂 lol, this is the end of Randolly…  Wait Randolly maybe that could be the name of the app. Maybe the app isn’t such a failure after all
It can’t be worse than Google wave - the project that was open sourced instead of being killed, wait a minute… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open source is the way to go, since nothing like “Randolly” has been open sourced- well we can’t be sure of that but I haven’t found anything like it on GitHub but since nothing like it has been open sourced we can create the first social media management app that is open source, immediately giving us an advantage over our competitors because our users can trust us. So there’s only one thing to do now…
Get rich 🤑 🤑 lets get rich and buy our parents houses in the suburbs yeah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open sourcing the startup only came as a last minute option as I was about to hit the kill button for Randolly, this was because I didn’t see the app going to the moon 🚀 instead it was going six feet down, also I made a prototype and the response I got from my frenemies is that the app sucked, some didn’t even open the link that’s how much they hate me but haters gonna hate , we are going to the moon by force even if we have to hijack the spaceship, And its not because I’m a  black South african 🇿🇦  🙃.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whats the better way than to have over-qualified developers working on your codebase for free, now that is thinking smart and not working at all, I’m joking having a startup open source startup is a lot of work and at the same  time there’s a lot to consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all i just want to clarify this one thing, I’m a high school student but since my startup is open source some people would criticize my bad code but guess what jokes on you cause I don’t care as long as it works, jeez i sound like a bad developer, but the proplem is the critisizer instead of complaining about the bad code why don’t you contribute to fix it mhmm 😒 who’s laughing now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second thing to consider about going open source is  security because instead of contributing some attackers will spend hours browsing your code just to find an exploit that they can use against your users but Linus’s law might work to our advantage “given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow”, that doesn’t mean we have to store passwords as text you also have to consider better ways of beefing up security on the bright side we might find security engineers contributing before the attackers attack, Its one of the benefits open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third thing to consider is intellectual theft where competitors steal your ideas to use on their own services but everyone steals ideas, do you think I’m the first person to think of social media management as a matter of fact I was inspired by the poor services given by buffer the point is that . In software ideas are cheap. Value is almost always created in execution of ideas. When you share your ideas with the world, it frees up your brain to focus on things that matter most. Instead of spending time worrying about which contractors or partners have access to your code base, you can focus on iterating faster. You’ll probably be surprised how the open source community responds to your openness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are also other benefits to make your startup open source: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It Solves your development talent problem because we would be creating a community of experts, experts that are good at solving problems with that being said we can say that the future of humanity looks great 👌 with good problem solving skills the rate of innovation increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It Improves product greatly, many companies are being accused of selling user data these days but since our code is open source people will develop a sense of trust towards the product but besides that competitors will use some of our ideas to better theirs but that’s the point of competition you want to make it a little better so with that said you can say that the future of social media management will increase greatly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But their are other benefits of opensourcing your startup that i haven’t mentioned this is just the tip of the ice either way everyone benefits from open source, the people, competitors, and the service in general 🚀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world with no open source, technology companies everywhere are re-inventing the wheel, on loop… forever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I just opensourced Randolly because I didn’t want  to waste developer time and effort! It is still in it’s prototype phase.

&lt;p&gt;Today is the day i can feel it in my day im just going to pull up to her try and win again, right now i don’t know what im going to say but i have the confidence to go and tell her how i feel about her❣️ It might end in tears though because we’ve never actually talked before and also she doesn’t know my name (i think) but I’ll just approach her with a strategy 😏 its quite simple, so last term i saw her wearing a shirt that says “girls code” ” hackathon” and shit 🔥 like that but because of my knowledge in the field i might be able to win her 💓 heart. First I’ll ask her just to confirm that its true, if it is then I’ll be like “tell me what language you use and I’ll tell you how sexy yoy are ”🔥🔥 see I’m a beast🙄 and I’ll just have a casual conversation with her and when the moment is right I’ll tell her how i feel about her👌 hopefully i might have won her heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh shit its after break and i panicked, as i looked into those eyes i ran out of words to say, my heart started racing, and i just acted cool and ignored her as i usually ignore people, i just pretended as if she didn’t exist, it was at this moment in time that i realised I’m weak have confidence the one minute and the other it be gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh shit its after school and i just saw her with another guy, well obviously my mind just jumped into a conclusion and figured out they are dating 🙄 even though I’m not sure, but for a girl as beautiful as her, they have to be dating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe i need an internal makeover and change a few things about myself, have more confidence after all. And ges I’m still going to shoot my shot with that girl💔, I’ll also  first try and be friends with her and try to talk to ther girls (as friends of course) by talking to more girls I’ll increase my confidence when around them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goal setting is important because you know exactly what you want to achieve, i don’t really know why i don’t set goals because I want to achieve a lot of things. First of all i want to create a startup, know im not saying its going to succeed but if it does i will drop out of school, a long goal of mine. Another thing i would like to do this year is to start a YouTube channel 🔥 a tech channel,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I don’t have what it takes but i want to build that skill
Because research says you learn better if you teach others, so i want to make the YouTube channel so that i can learn data structures and algorithms as well as building startups, so i want to document my tech journey from now onwards and is also the prime reason why i started this blog i want to document everything so that i can come back and reflect  on what i have done in my life to build on my career and also an opportunity for others to grow from my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now most of you are probably thinking why I’m not talking about school the thing is i don’t care about school the subjects they teach are not worth my interest, but that doesn’t mean i should fail, i still do well in school 😌 i mean
Failing would only bring me back and we don’t want that we just want to move forward / succeed, i mean i would like to improve on some of my marks especially for the ones i did bad at last term  for example i got 66% for physics but an 80% would look better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course my programming skills need to improve and is also the prime reason for starting a startup.So its a win win situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the reason why I’m writing this down is because ill stand a better chance of actually accomplishing if the public knows and if i don’t accomplish it they will probably think that im a failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today marks the beginning of the second term  hell again, you know sometimes I just don’t understand the school system like what is it trying to achieve because today we live in a completely different world. Their first mistake is that they teach us the skills we don’t want to learn and the skills we want to learn are not included, i learnt more from YouTube then school, YouTube even thought me to code,  you see that’s the skill i wanted to learn and since learnt it willingly you put in more hours without someone forcing you, yet with school you are forced to learn what they want you to learn the problem 😒 with that is that they also expect you to pass or do well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No wonder i want to drop out so badly its then they are pushing me to the edge. I actually spoke to my father about dropping out he says the only way for me to do that is to create a pasaive income, and since i want to drop out so badly i even thought about freelance  but now what’s on my mind is to create a startup, but that’s the problem i don’t know how to make it successful because school doesn’t teach you that see where im going school is  often glorified for the things it doesn’t do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let  me guess they want us to get a job right after graduating what about teaching you to be self-employed, especially with the current unemployment rate thats in our counties what about that🙄&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they want me to take school seriously 🤣 never.
I will fail proudly 😊&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We as humans don’t want to feel bored or lonely we decrease our dopamine by doing that, we always want to be around people All the time because that is what makes us happy, but i have become anti social i don’t care about people anymore  these days if i get a notification that says i have a text message, i won’t scream and shout saying that i have one that’s the old me, the thing is i don’t get as much pleasure as i used to get, i spend most of my time today in front of a computer screen i just don’t care about the shit that happens around me, being around people and having social conversation just feels weird now 😔 and it’s hard for me to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean im so lonely that i can’t even find a proper startup co-founder yes i have recently decided to start a startup
I think its because I don’t have the proper friends that are capable of managing, wait i don’t think I even have friends
Right now I’m in the state where im writing everything that comes to mind and i just realised that I might not even have real friends  like don’t friends check up on you regularly 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gosh know im thinking to my self am i that boring that now one wants to be around me its probably the reason why i feel lonely i mean i am lonely.The only place to turn to right now is to my computer atleast it won’t forsake me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe being lonely or bored is such a bad thing given that you are given a lot of quality time to work on yourself to carefully look at yourself see what you can change you van finally see what you can build and who knows you might build the next big thing thats why i have decided to focus on my startup company alone😏&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(post to be improved)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all I am a South African, more importantly a high school student (grade 11 to be specific). I am a self taught developer, currently mastering javascript. I am currently working on a project that is a web application that will allow users … shh we dont want to spoil the fun and reveal the whole idea it might get zucked.ITS A BILLION DOLLAR APP IDEA 😎&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t really do any Software development subjects in school mainly because my school doesn’t offer it, besides CAT but that is too easy for me to get bored of.Look at me talking about school, lol i don’t even like school i have always wanted to drop out since the eight grade(thats also the year when my coding skills advanced i think 2019).
I mean what is the point of school anyways i have already discovered my passion (coding) and i am now ready to start my career.BUT NO, NO ONE WANTS TO HIRE A 16 YEAR OLD CODER, especially in south africa they want qualifications obtained in university, what ever happened to skill is more important, mhmm i wonder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I can’t drop out of school, I decided to create my own app idea that is going to the MOON 🌕.
My only problem is time management as i tend to procastinate most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s not a bad problem to have and I’m not complaining. (Folks from minority groups often suffer the opposite bias despite their hard-earned credentials, and that &lt;em&gt;sucks&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this post I’ll offer an incomplete list of programming topics that people often wrongly assume that I know.&lt;/strong&gt; I’m not saying &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; don’t need to learn them — or that I don’t know &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; useful things. But since I’m not in a vulnerable position myself right now, I can be honest about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s why I think it’s important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there is often an unrealistic expectation that an experienced engineer knows every technology in their field. Have you seen a “learning roadmap” that consists of a hundred libraries and tools? It’s useful — but intimidating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more, no matter how experienced you get, you may still find yourself switching between feeling capable, inadequate (“Impostor syndrome”), and overconfident (“Dunning–Kruger effect”). It depends on your environment, job, personality, teammates, mental state, time of day, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experienced developers sometimes open up about their insecurities to encourage beginners. But there’s a world of difference between a seasoned surgeon who still gets the jitters and a student holding their first scalpel!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearing how “we’re all junior developers” can be disheartening and sound like empty talk to the learners faced with an actual gap in knowledge. Feel-good confessions from well-intentioned practitioners like me can’t bridge it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, even experienced engineers have many knowledge gaps. This post is about mine, and I encourage those who can afford similar vulnerability to share their own. But let’s not devalue our experience while we do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We can admit our knowledge gaps, may or may not feel like impostors, and still have deeply valuable expertise that takes years of hard work to develop.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that disclaimer out of the way, here’s just a few things I don’t know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unix commands and Bash.&lt;/strong&gt; I can &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; but I look up everything else. I get the concept of piping but I’ve only used it in simple cases. I don’t know how to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;xargs&lt;/code&gt; to create complex chains, or how to compose and redirect different output streams. I also never properly learned Bash so I can only write very simple (and often buggy) shell scripts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low-level languages.&lt;/strong&gt; I understand Assembly lets you store things in memory and jump around the code but that’s about it. I wrote a few lines of C and understand what a pointer is, but I don’t know how to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; or other manual memory management techniques. Never played with Rust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Networking stack.&lt;/strong&gt; I know computers have IP addresses, and DNS is how we resolve hostnames. I know there’s low level protocols like TCP/IP to exchange packets that (maybe?) ensure integrity. That’s it — I’m fuzzy on details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Containers.&lt;/strong&gt; I have no idea about how to use Docker or Kubernetes. (Are those related?) I have a vague idea that they let me spin up a separate VM in a predictable way. Sounds cool but I haven’t tried it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serverless.&lt;/strong&gt; Also sounds cool. Never tried it. I don’t have a clear idea of how that model changes backend programming (if it does at all).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microservices.&lt;/strong&gt; If I understand correctly, this just means “many API endpoints talking to each other”. I don’t know what the practical advantages or downsides of this approach are because I haven’t worked with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Python.&lt;/strong&gt; I feel bad about this one — I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; worked with Python for several years at some point and I’ve never bothered to actually learn it. There are many things there like import behavior that are completely opaque to me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Node backends.&lt;/strong&gt; I understand how to run Node, used some APIs like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fs&lt;/code&gt; for build tooling, and can set up Express. But I’ve never talked from Node to a database and don’t really know how to write a backend in it. I’m also not familiar with React frameworks like Next beyond a “hello world”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Native platforms.&lt;/strong&gt; I tried learning Objective C at some point but it didn’t work out. I haven’t learned Swift either. Same about Java. (I could probably pick it up though since I worked with C#.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Algorithms.&lt;/strong&gt; The most you’ll get out of me is bubble sort and maybe quicksort on a good day. I can probably do simple graph traversing tasks if they’re tied to a particular practical problem. I understand the O(n) notation but my understanding isn’t much deeper than “don’t put loops inside loops”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functional languages.&lt;/strong&gt; Unless you count JavaScript, I’m not fluent in any traditionally functional language. (I’m only fluent in C# and JavaScript — and I already forgot most of C#.) I struggle to read either LISP-inspired (like Clojure), Haskell-inspired (like Elm), or ML-inspired (like OCaml) code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functional terminology.&lt;/strong&gt; Map and reduce is as far as I go. I don’t know monoids, functors, etc. I know what a monad is but maybe that’s an illusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modern CSS.&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t know Flexbox or Grid. Floats are my jam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSS Methodologies.&lt;/strong&gt; I used BEM (meaning the CSS part, not the original BEM) but that’s all I know. I haven’t tried OOCSS or other methodologies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCSS / Sass.&lt;/strong&gt; Never got to learn them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CORS.&lt;/strong&gt; I dread these errors! I know I need to set up some headers to fix them but I’ve wasted hours here in the past.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTTPS / SSL.&lt;/strong&gt; Never set it up. Don’t know how it works beyond the idea of private and public keys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GraphQL.&lt;/strong&gt; I can read a query but I don’t really know how to express stuff with nodes and edges, when to use fragments, and how pagination works there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sockets.&lt;/strong&gt; My mental model is they let computers talk to each other outside the request/response model but that’s about all I know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streams.&lt;/strong&gt; Aside from Rx Observables, I haven’t worked with streams closely. I used old Node streams one or two times but always messed up error handling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electron.&lt;/strong&gt; Never tried it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TypeScript.&lt;/strong&gt; I understand the concept of types and can read annotations but I’ve never written it. The few times I tried, I ran into difficulties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deployment and devops.&lt;/strong&gt; I can manage to send some files over FTP or kill some processes but that’s the limit of my devops skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Graphics.&lt;/strong&gt; Whether it’s canvas, SVG, WebGL or low-level graphics, I’m not productive in it. I get the overall idea but I’d need to learn the primitives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this list is not exhaustive. There are many things that I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might seem like a strange thing to discuss. It even feels wrong to write it. Am I boasting of my ignorance? My intended takeaway from this post is that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even your favorite developers may not know many things that you know.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regardless of your knowledge level, your confidence can vary greatly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experienced developers have valuable expertise despite knowledge gaps.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m aware of my knowledge gaps (at least, some of them). I can fill them in later if I become curious or if I need them for a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t devalue my knowledge and experience. There’s plenty of things that I can do well. For example, learning technologies when I need them.&lt;/p&gt;
