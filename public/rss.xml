A place that glorifies itself by calling itself a place of learning even though you don’t learn the skills you want to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today marks the beginning of the second term  hell again, you know sometimes I just don’t understand the school system like what is it trying to achieve because today we live in a completely different world. Their first mistake is that they teach us the skills we don’t want to learn and the skills we want to learn are not included, i learnt more from YouTube then school, YouTube even thought me to code,  you see that’s the skill i wanted to learn and since learnt it willingly you put in more hours without someone forcing you, yet with school you are forced to learn what they want you to learn the problem 😒 with that is that they also expect you to pass or do well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No wonder i want to drop out so badly its then they are pushing me to the edge. I actually spoke to my father about dropping out he says the only way for me to do that is to create a pasaive income, and since i want to drop out so badly i even thought about freelance  but now what’s on my mind is to create a startup, but that’s the problem i don’t know how to make it successful because school doesn’t teach you that see where im going school is  often glorified for the things it doesn’t do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let  me guess they want us to get a job right after graduating what about teaching you to be self-employed, especially with the current unemployment rate thats in our counties what about that🙄&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they want me to take school seriously 🤣 never.
I will fail proudly 😊&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We as humans don’t want to feel bored or lonely we decrease our dopamine by doing that, we always want to be around people All the time because that is what makes us happy, but i have become anti social i don’t care about people anymore  these days if i get a notification that says i have a text message, i won’t scream and shout saying that i have one that’s the old me, the thing is i don’t get as much pleasure as i used to get, i spend most of my time today in front of a computer screen i just don’t care about the shit that happens around me, being around people and having social conversation just feels weird now 😔 and it’s hard for me to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean im so lonely that i can’t even find a proper startup co-founder yes i have recently decided to start a startup
I think its because I don’t have the proper friends that are capable of managing, wait i don’t think I even have friends
Right now I’m in the state where im writing everything that comes to mind and i just realised that I might not even have real friends  like don’t friends check up on you regularly 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gosh know im thinking to my self am i that boring that now one wants to be around me its probably the reason why i feel lonely i mean i am lonely.The only place to turn to right now is to my computer atleast it won’t forsake me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe being lonely or bored is such a bad thing given that you are given a lot of quality time to work on yourself to carefully look at yourself see what you can change you van finally see what you can build and who knows you might build the next big thing thats why i have decided to focus on my startup company alone😏&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(post to be improved)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all I am a South African, more importantly a high school student (grade 11 to be specific). I am a self taught developer, currently mastering javascript. I am currently working on a project that is a web application that will allow users … shh we dont want to spoil the fun and reveal the whole idea it might get zucked.ITS A BILLION DOLLAR APP IDEA 😎&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t really do any Software development subjects in school mainly because my school doesn’t offer it, besides CAT but that is too easy for me to get bored of.Look at me talking about school, lol i don’t even like school i have always wanted to drop out since the eight grade(thats also the year when my coding skills advanced i think 2019).
I mean what is the point of school anyways i have already discovered my passion (coding) and i am now ready to start my career.BUT NO, NO ONE WANTS TO HIRE A 16 YEAR OLD CODER, especially in south africa they want qualifications obtained in university, what ever happened to skill is more important, mhmm i wonder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I can’t drop out of school, I decided to create my own app idea that is going to the MOON 🌕.
My only problem is time management as i tend to procastinate most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s not a bad problem to have and I’m not complaining. (Folks from minority groups often suffer the opposite bias despite their hard-earned credentials, and that &lt;em&gt;sucks&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this post I’ll offer an incomplete list of programming topics that people often wrongly assume that I know.&lt;/strong&gt; I’m not saying &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; don’t need to learn them — or that I don’t know &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; useful things. But since I’m not in a vulnerable position myself right now, I can be honest about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s why I think it’s important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there is often an unrealistic expectation that an experienced engineer knows every technology in their field. Have you seen a “learning roadmap” that consists of a hundred libraries and tools? It’s useful — but intimidating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more, no matter how experienced you get, you may still find yourself switching between feeling capable, inadequate (“Impostor syndrome”), and overconfident (“Dunning–Kruger effect”). It depends on your environment, job, personality, teammates, mental state, time of day, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experienced developers sometimes open up about their insecurities to encourage beginners. But there’s a world of difference between a seasoned surgeon who still gets the jitters and a student holding their first scalpel!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearing how “we’re all junior developers” can be disheartening and sound like empty talk to the learners faced with an actual gap in knowledge. Feel-good confessions from well-intentioned practitioners like me can’t bridge it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, even experienced engineers have many knowledge gaps. This post is about mine, and I encourage those who can afford similar vulnerability to share their own. But let’s not devalue our experience while we do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We can admit our knowledge gaps, may or may not feel like impostors, and still have deeply valuable expertise that takes years of hard work to develop.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that disclaimer out of the way, here’s just a few things I don’t know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unix commands and Bash.&lt;/strong&gt; I can &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; but I look up everything else. I get the concept of piping but I’ve only used it in simple cases. I don’t know how to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;xargs&lt;/code&gt; to create complex chains, or how to compose and redirect different output streams. I also never properly learned Bash so I can only write very simple (and often buggy) shell scripts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low-level languages.&lt;/strong&gt; I understand Assembly lets you store things in memory and jump around the code but that’s about it. I wrote a few lines of C and understand what a pointer is, but I don’t know how to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; or other manual memory management techniques. Never played with Rust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Networking stack.&lt;/strong&gt; I know computers have IP addresses, and DNS is how we resolve hostnames. I know there’s low level protocols like TCP/IP to exchange packets that (maybe?) ensure integrity. That’s it — I’m fuzzy on details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Containers.&lt;/strong&gt; I have no idea about how to use Docker or Kubernetes. (Are those related?) I have a vague idea that they let me spin up a separate VM in a predictable way. Sounds cool but I haven’t tried it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serverless.&lt;/strong&gt; Also sounds cool. Never tried it. I don’t have a clear idea of how that model changes backend programming (if it does at all).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microservices.&lt;/strong&gt; If I understand correctly, this just means “many API endpoints talking to each other”. I don’t know what the practical advantages or downsides of this approach are because I haven’t worked with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Python.&lt;/strong&gt; I feel bad about this one — I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; worked with Python for several years at some point and I’ve never bothered to actually learn it. There are many things there like import behavior that are completely opaque to me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Node backends.&lt;/strong&gt; I understand how to run Node, used some APIs like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fs&lt;/code&gt; for build tooling, and can set up Express. But I’ve never talked from Node to a database and don’t really know how to write a backend in it. I’m also not familiar with React frameworks like Next beyond a “hello world”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Native platforms.&lt;/strong&gt; I tried learning Objective C at some point but it didn’t work out. I haven’t learned Swift either. Same about Java. (I could probably pick it up though since I worked with C#.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Algorithms.&lt;/strong&gt; The most you’ll get out of me is bubble sort and maybe quicksort on a good day. I can probably do simple graph traversing tasks if they’re tied to a particular practical problem. I understand the O(n) notation but my understanding isn’t much deeper than “don’t put loops inside loops”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functional languages.&lt;/strong&gt; Unless you count JavaScript, I’m not fluent in any traditionally functional language. (I’m only fluent in C# and JavaScript — and I already forgot most of C#.) I struggle to read either LISP-inspired (like Clojure), Haskell-inspired (like Elm), or ML-inspired (like OCaml) code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functional terminology.&lt;/strong&gt; Map and reduce is as far as I go. I don’t know monoids, functors, etc. I know what a monad is but maybe that’s an illusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modern CSS.&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t know Flexbox or Grid. Floats are my jam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSS Methodologies.&lt;/strong&gt; I used BEM (meaning the CSS part, not the original BEM) but that’s all I know. I haven’t tried OOCSS or other methodologies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCSS / Sass.&lt;/strong&gt; Never got to learn them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CORS.&lt;/strong&gt; I dread these errors! I know I need to set up some headers to fix them but I’ve wasted hours here in the past.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTTPS / SSL.&lt;/strong&gt; Never set it up. Don’t know how it works beyond the idea of private and public keys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GraphQL.&lt;/strong&gt; I can read a query but I don’t really know how to express stuff with nodes and edges, when to use fragments, and how pagination works there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sockets.&lt;/strong&gt; My mental model is they let computers talk to each other outside the request/response model but that’s about all I know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streams.&lt;/strong&gt; Aside from Rx Observables, I haven’t worked with streams closely. I used old Node streams one or two times but always messed up error handling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electron.&lt;/strong&gt; Never tried it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TypeScript.&lt;/strong&gt; I understand the concept of types and can read annotations but I’ve never written it. The few times I tried, I ran into difficulties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deployment and devops.&lt;/strong&gt; I can manage to send some files over FTP or kill some processes but that’s the limit of my devops skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Graphics.&lt;/strong&gt; Whether it’s canvas, SVG, WebGL or low-level graphics, I’m not productive in it. I get the overall idea but I’d need to learn the primitives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this list is not exhaustive. There are many things that I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might seem like a strange thing to discuss. It even feels wrong to write it. Am I boasting of my ignorance? My intended takeaway from this post is that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even your favorite developers may not know many things that you know.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regardless of your knowledge level, your confidence can vary greatly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experienced developers have valuable expertise despite knowledge gaps.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m aware of my knowledge gaps (at least, some of them). I can fill them in later if I become curious or if I need them for a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t devalue my knowledge and experience. There’s plenty of things that I can do well. For example, learning technologies when I need them.&lt;/p&gt;
