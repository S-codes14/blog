Their first mistake is that they teach us the skills we don't want to learn and the skills we want to learn are not included, i learnt more from YouTube then school, YouTube even thought me to code,  you see that's the skill i wanted to learn and since learnt it willingly you put in more hours without someone forcing you, yet with school you are forced to learn what they want you to learn the problem 😒 with that is that they also expect you to pass or do well.</p>\n<p>No wonder i want to drop out so badly its then they are pushing me to the edge. I actually spoke to my father about dropping out he says the only way for me to do that is to create a pasaive income, and since i want to drop out so badly i even thought about freelance  but now what's on my mind is to create a startup, but that's the problem i don't know how to make it successful because school doesn't teach you that see where im going school is  often glorified for the things it doesn't do.</p>\n<p>Let  me guess they want us to get a job right after graduating what about teaching you to be self-employed, especially with the current unemployment rate thats in our counties what about that🙄</p>\n<p>Then they want me to take school seriously 🤣 never.\nI will fail proudly 😊</p>","id":"532d335a-42f9-5009-83c7-cb0ddcc6263a","fields":{"slug":"back-to-school-😔"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2022-04-05","title":"Back to school😔 ","category":"Life","tags":["Life"],"banner":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F4ed8c503-93ef-4cb5-adc0-278fd0dff73d.jpg?fit=scale-down&source=next&width=700"},"timeToRead":1},{"excerpt":"Have you ever felt alone, its probably the worst feeling now imagine i have to be alone all the time, i mean i don't have real people to call friends sometimes I don't even get a text message from anyone it was worse last year when no one remembered…","html":"<p>Have you ever felt alone, its probably the worst feeling now imagine i have to be alone all the time, i mean i don't have real people to call friends sometimes I don't even get a text message from anyone it was worse last year when no one remembered my birthday so no one said happy birthday until the next day, have you ever felt forgotten.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lonliness\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#lonliness\" aria-label=\"lonliness permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Lonliness</h2>\n<p>We as humans don't want to feel bored or lonely we decrease our dopamine by doing that, we always want to be around people All the time because that is what makes us happy, but i have become anti social i don't care about people anymore  these days if i get a notification that says i have a text message, i won't scream and shout saying that i have one that's the old me, the thing is i don't get as much pleasure as i used to get, i spend most of my time today in front of a computer screen i just don't care about the shit that happens around me, being around people and having social conversation just feels weird now 😔 and it's hard for me to do so.</p>\n<p>I mean im so lonely that i can't even find a proper startup co-founder yes i have recently decided to start a startup\nI think its because I don't have the proper friends that are capable of managing, wait i don't think I even have friends\nRight now I'm in the state where im writing everything that comes to mind and i just realised that I might not even have real friends  like don't friends check up on you regularly 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭</p>\n<p>Gosh know im thinking to my self am i that boring that now one wants to be around me its probably the reason why i feel lonely i mean i am lonely.The only place to turn to right now is to my computer atleast it won't forsake me.</p>\n<p>Maybe being lonely or bored is such a bad thing given that you are given a lot of quality time to work on yourself to carefully look at yourself see what you can change you van finally see what you can build and who knows you might build the next big thing thats why i have decided to focus on my startup company alone😏</p>","id":"08ec3035-495f-5add-8f42-9a3ffca74235","fields":{"slug":"in-a-lonely-world-😔"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2022-04-04","title":"In a lonely World 😔 ","category":"Life","tags":["Life"],"banner":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F4ed8c503-93ef-4cb5-adc0-278fd0dff73d.jpg?fit=scale-down&source=next&width=700"},"timeToRead":2},{"excerpt":"Welcome this is literally the first post.If i were to write about myself or give myself a description I would say I am a 16 year who loves to transform ideas into reality using code.
