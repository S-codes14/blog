First of all i want to create a startup, know im not saying its going to succeed but if it does i will drop out of school, a long goal of mine. Another thing i would like to do this year is to start a YouTube channel ðŸ”¥ a tech channel,</p>\n<p>I know I donâ€™t have what it takes but i want to build that skill\nBecause research says you learn better if you teach others, so i want to make the YouTube channel so that i can learn data structures and algorithms as well as building startups, so i want to document my tech journey from now onwards and is also the prime reason why i started this blog i want to document everything so that i can come back and reflect  on what i have done in my life to build on my career and also an opportunity for others to grow from my experience.</p>\n<p>Right now most of you are probably thinking why Iâ€™m not talking about school the thing is i donâ€™t care about school the subjects they teach are not worth my interest, but that doesnâ€™t mean i should fail, i still do well in school ðŸ˜Œ i mean\nFailing would only bring me back and we donâ€™t want that we just want to move forward / succeed, i mean i would like to improve on some of my marks especially for the ones i did bad at last term  for example i got 66% for physics but an 80% would look better. </p>\n<p>And of course my programming skills need to improve and is also the prime reason for starting a startup.So its a win win situation.</p>\n<p>And the reason why Iâ€™m writing this down is because ill stand a better chance of actually accomplishing if the public knows and if i donâ€™t accomplish it they will probably think that im a failure.</p>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"title":"goals - things to be done ðŸ”¥","date":"April 16, 2022","spoiler":"Im not really a person that sets goals but there are some things i would like to accomplish in the short term","cta":null},"fields":{"slug":"/Goals/","langKey":"en"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/Goals/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/back-to-school/","langKey":"en","directoryName":"back-to-school","maybeAbsoluteLinks":[]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Back to schoolðŸ˜” "}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/I-have-feelings/","langKey":"en","directoryName":"I-have-feelings","maybeAbsoluteLinks":[]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Talking to my crush ðŸ’“"}},"translations":[],"translatedLinks":[]}},"staticQueryHashes":["336482444"]}
