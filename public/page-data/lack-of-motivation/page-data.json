Everything i don’t like doing but have to do is a waste of time and energy and it ends up pissing you off not to mention it being tedious.</p>\n<p>The other day we were given an English essay that was said to count 50% of our term mark, given that offering i even gave up my coding time just to perfect the essay, so i put in so much effort just to get a moderate mark i git 27/50 WTF 🤬.</p>\n<p>So again the teacher gave us an opportunity to redo the essay, as much as this can improve my term mark, I’m like fuck that 🤬 . I don’t have the motivation to write another essay just to get a discouraging mark, oh hell no, never🤕.</p>\n<p>What i have come to realise is that school  is a place to go and kill your dreams, i thought that the essay was perfect 👌 especially given the time and effort I’ve put in.
