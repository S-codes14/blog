First I’ll ask her just to confirm that its true, if it is then I’ll be like “tell me what language you use and I’ll tell you how sexy yoy are ”🔥🔥 see I’m a beast🙄 and I’ll just have a casual conversation with her and when the moment is right I’ll tell her how i feel about her👌 hopefully i might have won her heart.</p>\n<p>Oh shit its after break and i panicked, as i looked into those eyes i ran out of words to say, my heart started racing, and i just acted cool and ignored her as i usually ignore people, i just pretended as if she didn’t exist, it was at this moment in time that i realised I’m weak have confidence the one minute and the other it be gone.</p>\n<p>Oh shit its after school and i just saw her with another guy, well obviously my mind just jumped into a conclusion and figured out they are dating 🙄 even though I’m not sure, but for a girl as beautiful as her, they have to be dating.</p>\n<p>But maybe i need an internal makeover and change a few things about myself, have more confidence after all. And ges I’m still going to shoot my shot with that girl💔, I’ll also  first try and be friends with her and try to talk to ther girls (as friends of course) by talking to more girls I’ll increase my confidence when around them.</p>","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"title":"Talking to my crush 💓","date":"April 21, 2022","spoiler":"I think I finally have the confidence to talk to my crush","cta":null},"fields":{"slug":"/I-have-feelings/","langKey":"en"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/I-have-feelings/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Goals/","langKey":"en","directoryName":"Goals","maybeAbsoluteLinks":[]},"frontmatter":{"title":"goals - things to be done 🔥"}},"next":null,"translations":[],"translatedLinks":[]}},"staticQueryHashes":["336482444"]}
