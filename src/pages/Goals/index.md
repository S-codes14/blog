Im not really a person that sets goals but there are some things i would like to accomplish in the short term

Goal setting is important because you know exactly what you want to achieve, i don't really know why i don't set goals because I want to achieve a lot of things. First of all i want to create a startup, know im not saying its going to succeed but if it does i will drop out of school, a long goal of mine. Another thing i would like to do this year is to start a YouTube channel ðŸ”¥ a tech channel,

I know I don't have what it takes but i want to build that skill 
Because research says you learn better if you teach others, so i want to make the YouTube channel so that i can learn data structures and algorithms as well as building startups, so i want to document my tech journey from now onwards and is also the prime reason why i started this blog i want to document everything so that i can come back and reflect  on what i have done in my life to build on my career and also an opportunity for others to grow from my experience.

Right now most of you are probably thinking why I'm not talking about school the thing is i don't care about school the subjects they teach are not worth my interest, but that doesn't mean i should fail, i still do well in school ðŸ˜Œ i mean 
Failing would only bring me back and we don't want that we just want to move forward / succeed, i mean i would like to improve on some of my marks especially for the ones i did bad at last term  for example i got 66% for physics but an 80% would look better. 

And of course my programming skills need to improve and is also the prime reason for starting a startup.So its a win win situation.

And the reason why I'm writing this down is because ill stand a better chance of actually accomplishing if the public knows and if i don't accomplish it they will probably think that im a failure.
