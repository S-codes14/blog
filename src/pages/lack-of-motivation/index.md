What's the point of anything ğŸ˜’. Everything i don't like doing but have to do is a waste of time and energy and it ends up pissing you off not to mention it being tedious.

The other day we were given an English essay that was said to count 50% of our term mark, given that offering i even gave up my coding time just to perfect the essay, so i put in so much effort just to get a moderate mark i git 27/50 WTF ğŸ¤¬.

So again the teacher gave us an opportunity to redo the essay, as much as this can improve my term mark, I'm like fuck that ğŸ¤¬ . I don't have the motivation to write another essay just to get a discouraging mark, oh hell no, neverğŸ¤•.

What i have come to realise is that school  is a place to go and kill your dreams, i thought that the essay was perfect ğŸ‘Œ especially given the time and effort I've put in. But it takes one red ink pen to kill it

I don't even have the motivation to continue writing this blog post, mxmm fuck
