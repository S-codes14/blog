The path of a self-taught developer can be scary and intimidating.

## Who am I Really?
(post to be improved)

First of all I am a South African, more importantly a high school student (grade 11 to be specific). I am a self taught developer, currently mastering javascript. I am currently working on a project that is a web application that will allow users ... shh we dont want to spoil the fun and reveal the whole idea it might get zucked.ITS A BILLION DOLLAR APP IDEA ðŸ˜Ž

I don't really do any Software development subjects in school mainly because my school doesn't offer it, besides CAT but that is too easy for me to get bored of.Look at me talking about school, lol i don't even like school i have always wanted to drop out since the eight grade(thats also the year when my coding skills advanced i think 2019).
I mean what is the point of school anyways i have already discovered my passion (coding) and i am now ready to start my career.BUT NO, NO ONE WANTS TO HIRE A 16 YEAR OLD CODER, especially in south africa they want qualifications obtained in university, what ever happened to skill is more important, mhmm i wonder.

Since I can't drop out of school, I decided to create my own app idea that is going to the MOON ðŸŒ•.
My only problem is time management as i tend to procastinate most of the time.
