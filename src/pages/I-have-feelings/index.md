In my mind I still revisit that day, the day I first saw her my mind was all over the place 🧐 when she smiled something in my stomach will crawl, thats when I knew that I'm in love.I didn't do or say anything though 😔 except think about her the whole time.

Today is the day i can feel it in my day im just going to pull up to her try and win again, right now i don't know what im going to say but i have the confidence to go and tell her how i feel about her❣️ It might end in tears though because we've never actually talked before and also she doesn't know my name (i think) but I'll just approach her with a strategy 😏 its quite simple, so last term i saw her wearing a shirt that says "girls code" " hackathon" and shit 🔥 like that but because of my knowledge in the field i might be able to win her 💓 heart. First I'll ask her just to confirm that its true, if it is then I'll be like "tell me what language you use and I'll tell you how sexy yoy are "🔥🔥 see I'm a beast🙄 and I'll just have a casual conversation with her and when the moment is right I'll tell her how i feel about her👌 hopefully i might have won her heart.



Oh shit its after break and i panicked, as i looked into those eyes i ran out of words to say, my heart started racing, and i just acted cool and ignored her as i usually ignore people, i just pretended as if she didn't exist, it was at this moment in time that i realised I'm weak have confidence the one minute and the other it be gone.


Oh shit its after school and i just saw her with another guy, well obviously my mind just jumped into a conclusion and figured out they are dating 🙄 even though I'm not sure, but for a girl as beautiful as her, they have to be dating.

But maybe i need an internal makeover and change a few things about myself, have more confidence after all. And ges I'm still going to shoot my shot with that girl💔, I'll also  first try and be friends with her and try to talk to ther girls (as friends of course) by talking to more girls I'll increase my confidence when around them.
